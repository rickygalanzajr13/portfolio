                <p>Payroll System that allows the user input employee name, hourly rate, hour per day, and number of days worked. Then it will calculate these (Hourly RateXHours Per DayXNumber of Days Worked) to generate a gross pay, as well as the tax deductions with a fixed percentage deduction in the system. The system then will generate the net pay by deducting the total of tax deductions to the gross pay. After computing all of the data, the user will add these into the table, which will appear on the right side of the system. Below the add button are three button: the Receipt button, which converts all of an employee's calculated data into a check. Delete button: to delete any row by clicking on them first. Finally, clear button, to clear all of the rows in the table. This system uses MYSQL database to store collected data.</p>
